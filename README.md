# CompVision_ImageProc
### Fall 2018, University at Buffalo.
## Description
This repository includes three projects from course cs573 CompVision_ImageProc.

## Prerequisites
There two versions of source code. To run it, you need:
#### To run the .py version  
To intall python3 :  
	https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/  
To install Numpy and Matplotlib :  
    	https://www.scipy.org/install.html     
#### To run the .ipynb version:  
To intall python3, Numpy and Matplotlib as mentioned above.   
To install jupyter notebook :  
	http://jupyter.org/install  
#### To use opencv
There are ways to install opencv on windows and Linux in opencv-python-tutroals book.
For mac user, we could follow these steps:
1. install opencv on mac:

2. create python virtual environment:  
    1) Create : python3 -m venv tutorial-env  
    2) Run    : source tutorial-env/bin/activate  
    3) Exit   : deactivate  
3.Use jupyter notebooks in the virtual environment
